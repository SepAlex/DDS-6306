Budwise provided 2 data files, Beers and Breweries.  My firm was employeed to use the data sets and provided a suggestion to Budwiser if they should enter the craft beer market.  
Our final conclusion was there is enough evidence that supports Budwiser entering the craft beer market.  However, we did recommend further analysis regarding beer compution and beer style preferences.
